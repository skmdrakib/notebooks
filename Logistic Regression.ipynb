    "- Classifier: An algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.\n",
    "- Classification model: A classification model tries to draw some conclusion from the input values given for training. It will predict the class labels/categories for the new data.\n",
    "- Feature: A feature is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.\n",
    "- Binary Classification: Classification task with two possible outcomes. Eg: Gender classification (Male / Female)\n",
    "- Multi class classification: Classification with more than two classes. In multi class classification each sample is assigned to one and only one target label. Eg: An animal can be cat or dog but not both at the same time\n",
    "- Multi label classification: Classification task where each sample is mapped to a set of target labels (more than one class). Eg: A news article can be about sports, a person, and location at the same time."

    "feature with the smallest parameter (notice that this assumes the features are either rescaled or standardized), meaning it is less important, and remove the feature from the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question then is: how many features should we keep? We can (hypothetically) repeat this loop until we only have one feature left. A better approach requires that we include a new concept called cross-validation (CV). but here is the general idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data containing 1) a target we want to predict and 2) a feature matrix, first we split the data into two groups: a training set and a test set. Second, we train our model using the training set. Third, we pretend that we do not know the target of the test set, and apply our model to the test setâ€™s features in order to predict the values of the test set. Finally, we compare our predicted target values with the true target values to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use CV to find the optimum number of features to keep during RFE. Specifically, in RFE with CV after every iteration, we use cross-validation to evaluate our model. If CV shows that our model improved after we eliminated a feature, then we continue on to the next loop. However, if CV shows that our model got worse after we eliminated a feature, we put that feature back into the feature set and select those features as the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, RFE with CV is implemented using RFECV and contains a number of important parameters. The estimator parameter determines the type of model we want to train (e.g., linear regression). The step regression sets the number or proportion of features to drop during each loop. The scoring parameter sets the metric of quality we use to evaluate our model during cross-validation."
